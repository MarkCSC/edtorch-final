# AI-Enhanced Mathematics Education Platform - EdTorch

This repository contains the source code for an AI-enhanced educational platform designed to improve the learning and teaching of mathematics at the secondary school level, specifically tailored for the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) curriculum.

## Overview

The platform utilizes advanced AI technologies to assist teachers in generating and analyzing homework questions, and provides students with personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement. This system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates several Gen-AI models to diagnose student weaknesses, and generate educational content.

## Features

- **Question Generation and Tagging:** Utilizes generative AI to aid teachers in creating and categorizing homework questions.
- **Automatic Feedback System:** Analyzes student responses to provide immediate feedback and insights into their understanding and misconceptions.
- **Strength and Weakness Analysis:** AI models assess student performance to pinpoint areas of weakness and strength.
- **Interactive Learning Environment:** A user-friendly web interface built with React.js that enhances the learning experience.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Robust data handling and analysis capabilities with MongoDB to support educational research and improvement.
